Fuzzy Extractor and Elliptic Curve Based Efficient User Authentication Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks and Internet of Things
In order to simulate the proposed protocol on AVISPA v1.1, we use a Security Protocol ANimator
(SPAN) Version 1.6 on a computer system having ubuntu 16.04 LTS operating system (64 bit), Intel
(R) core (TM) i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50 GHz x4 processor, and 8 GB RAM. We extract the archive
avispa-package-1.1_Linux-i686.tgz, set up the environment variable AVISPA_PACKAGE and keep
the script of the avispa protocol in the execution path. We implement our protocol considering minimal
number of entities involved in WSNs/IoT (i.e, one user Ui, one sensor node SNj and one gateway node
GWN) using Dolev-Yao model [33] with a bounded number of sessions, specified goal, On-the-Fly
Model-Checker(OFMC) and Constraint-Logic based Attack Searcher (CL-AtSe) backend.
